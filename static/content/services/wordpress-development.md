## WordPress Development

Unlock the full potential of your website by combining the power of managing your content via WordPress with the
responsiveness and high performance of a modern web framework.

### New Websites

I specialise in creating new websites using a headless approach, offering a modern solution for dynamic and
high-performance sites. With a headless setup, your WordPress siteâ€™s backend and frontend are separated, allowing for
greater flexibility and customisation in design.

This approach enhances site speed and security while providing a more seamless integration with other technologies and
platforms. The result is a highly responsive, scalable website tailored to your specific needs, with improved
performance and a more engaging user experience.

### Existing Websites

Is your existing website in need of a new coat of paint? I can update the design, optimise performance, and add new
features, preserving your essential content and boosting user engagement and site security.

### Custom Plugins

I offer custom WordPress plugin development to enhance your site with unique features and functionalities not included
out of the box. Whether you need to add specialised capabilities, integrate with third-party services, or optimise
specific aspects of your site, I can create a custom plugin to meet your requirements.
